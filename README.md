**A Sorting Algorithm** is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure.

**Big O notation** is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.
